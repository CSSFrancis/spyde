SpyDE
=====

SpyDE is a python program built on top of Hyperspy.  It is designed to help with the visualization and analysis
of data from (Direct Electron) DE cameras and other electron microscopy detectors.


Installation
------------

Currently we only support installation via `pip`. Eventually a packaged "Application" will be 
provided for ease of use.

As spyde isn't (yet) hosted on pypi, you will need to install it directly from the github repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CSSFrancis/spyde.git
``` 

Once installed, spyde can be run from the command line using:

```bash
spyde
```
This will launch the spyde application.
