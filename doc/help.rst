Getting Help
------------

If you need help using the software, the easiest way is to ask questions in the github discussions. Someone will
usually be able to help.

If there is a bug please file an issue on github.  Please include as much information as possible including:
- Your operating system
- The version of SpyDE you are using
- A minimal example that reproduces the issue
- Any error messages you are seeing
